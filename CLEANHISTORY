Run the script to clean and reset

Copy and paste this script to your Console Script text area and change the "copy_folder" to project name that you need to clean the history. Then click the "Run button". 


def jobName = "copy_folder"
def job = Jenkins.instance.getItem(jobName)
job.getBuilds().each { it.delete() }
job.nextBuildNumber = 1
job.save()
Now check your Build History for the particular project, Wow!, it's clean now!
